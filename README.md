## Need to hop on the latest fashion trends? Try Spoint!

This website utilizes full stack development with a React.ts front end, aws-rds database, and a Spring Boot java server. The website was created for Spoint eCommerce to allow customers to use the website to purchase clothing articles. Once a customer lands on the site, they can browse items for sale. If a customer would like to purchase an item or items, they must register an account. This account will become their unique identifier to gain access. Customers can add items to cart and check out as needed. Upon checkout, emailJS will send the customer a confirmation email to the email address they registered with their account that contains a confirmation note and receipt of purchase.
